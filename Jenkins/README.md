# Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software, making it easier for developers to integrate changes and deliver updates to their applications more frequently and reliably.

Key features of Jenkins include:

**Extensibility:** Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins, allowing you to customize and extend its capabilities to suit your specific needs.

**Pipeline Support:** Jenkins provides support for creating complex CI/CD pipelines using a domain-specific language (DSL) or through a visual interface.

**Distributed Builds:** Jenkins can distribute build tasks across multiple machines, improving performance and scalability.

**Integration:** Jenkins integrates with various version control systems, such as Git, SVN, and Mercurial, as well as with other tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.

Jenkins is widely used in the software development industry for its flexibility, robustness, and ability to integrate with various tools and technologies.

## Installation

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)

### Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins

** For Ubuntu Instance** 

Install Java

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
```

Verify Java is Installed

```
java -version
```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

```
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```
to check if Jenkins is runing in background

```
ps -ef | grep jenkins
```
**Note:** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

- EC2 > Instances > Click on <Instance-ID>
- In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
- Security groups
- Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed `All traffic`).

### Login to Jenkins using the below URL:

http://<ec2-instance-public-ip-address>:8080    [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]

Note: If you are not interested in allowing `All Traffic` to your EC2 instance
      1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance
      2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port `8080`
  
After you login to Jenkins, 
      - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
      - Enter the Administrator password

Wait for the Jenkins to be restarted.


## Docker Slave Configuration

Run the below command to Install Docker

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```
 
### Grant Jenkins user and Ubuntu user permission to docker deamon.

```
sudo su - 
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG docker ubuntu
systemctl restart docker
```
To ensure docker is runing 
```
 su - jenkins
 docker run hello-world
```


Once you are done with the above steps, it is better to restart Jenkins.

```
http://<ec2-instance-public-ip>:8080/restart
```

The docker agent configuration is now successful.
